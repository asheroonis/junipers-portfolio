This is an engine that is made to connect with the ChatGPT API and turn the general-purpose generative AI into a master storyteller by tracking the state of the world, player inventory, history, etc. and feeding it back to the storyteller to give more meaningful and cohesive responses. I completed this project with my group members Sean McConnachie, Alex Lasenby, Stefan Zdravkovic and Karl Jackson. My primary role was as front-end developer. This project is available for demonstration upon request once completed.",

Functionality in this site is limited beyond opening and closing the modal form window as it is only meant to be a proof-of-concept prototype but it served as a helpful introduction to the language.

Beginning from a basic piece of art of the main character Amica (shown in slide 14), the game blossomed from there and we came up with a world full of stories and characters and enemies with their own unique mechanics. Marie was primarily the artist for the game while I was lead programmer, playing into our strengths to create something we were really proud of for the end of the year. Unfortunately the files for this game have been lost to time, but the memory and knowledge it brought us still remains.",

I undertook this project solo and created all of the art, scripting, etc. from scratch - it was another fantastic crash course in the development process (and why games usually have big teams working on them!) A lot of work went into narrative design in this project and ended up with an incredibly flesh-out story with many paths the user could take to get a total of 5 different endings. Sadly the files for this game have been lost to time but it still proved a great experience to develop and I took my newfound knowledge away with me. It secured me the award for Outstanding Achievement in Digital Technology in 2021, an achievement I was extremely proud to get given the overall quality of other students' work that year.",

This game was started with high hopes but I soon realised it has more value as a playground for my art and programming abilities - I will revisit it every month or so when I come up with an idea for a new mechanic I'd like to try coding or a new enemy I want to animate and just gradually build it up into a library of things I have figured out how to do. From grappling hooks to throwing boxes loosely around the level, to mimics jumping after the player and pigeons homing in on them, it has been a great way to hone my skills.

The destruction of the brick-based bridges was always very satisfying and while being in a simplistic environment, it was a good exercise in performance concerns and ensuring all of the entities were being cleaned up when not in use while still being able to be regenerated at the end of each round.

The JavaScript and CSS are also fully dynamic, so I do not need to touch the actual site code at all if I want to update the pages with a new project or add more photos of an existing one - I simply edit one list of projects and it will scale the webpages and adjust any slideshows, etc. accordingly. It is also set up in a way that functions could be easily implemented for the user to update the site from the front-end - however, since it is intended as a static site that showcases some set information, I have left it as only editable from the backend.
